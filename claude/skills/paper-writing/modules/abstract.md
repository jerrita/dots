## What I do

I help you write abstracts for security conference papers that effectively communicate your research to reviewers in 150-250 words. I ensure your abstract includes all critical elements: problem statement, existing limitations, core contribution, and quantitative results.

## When to use me

Use this skill when you're writing or revising the abstract for a security paper. The abstract is typically written last, after your paper is complete. I can help you:

- Structure your abstract with the four-part framework (problem → limitations → contribution → results)
- Ensure each part is concise yet complete
- Use strong, active language with quantitative claims
- Verify that your abstract stands alone without requiring readers to see the full paper

## How I work

I follow the proven four-paragraph structure for security paper abstracts:

**Paragraph 1: Problem Statement (30-40 words)**
- Describe the real-world security problem or system deficiency
- Explain why this problem matters and affects many systems
- Use specific data or concrete examples for impact

**Paragraph 2: Limitations of Existing Solutions (30-40 words)**
- Clearly identify why current defenses are insufficient
- Point to specific gaps or weaknesses
- Set up the need for a new approach

**Paragraph 3: Core Contribution (50-80 words)**
- State your main innovation clearly
- Explain the technical approach or method used
- Highlight what makes your solution special (low-cost, efficient, novel, etc.)

**Paragraph 4: Quantitative Results & Impact (40-60 words)**
- Provide concrete metrics (performance, security improvements)
- Explain what these results mean
- Use numbers, not qualitative descriptions

## Key principles

1. **Use active voice and strong verbs**: Replace "can be achieved" with "achieves" or "delivers"
2. **Quantify everything**: Never say "significant improvement" — say "3% throughput loss"
3. **Avoid excessive detail**: Abstract is not a condensed introduction
4. **Write last**: Complete your paper first, then write the abstract
5. **Self-check**: Can someone understand your paper's value from the abstract alone?

## Example structure

```
[Problem]: Security issue X affects system Y, impacting Z users/scenarios.

[Limitations]: Current defense mechanism A has limitation B, and approach C fails because D.

[Contribution]: We present Solution, which uses Technique to achieve Goal. Our approach addresses specific challenges E and F through design innovations G and H.

[Results]: Our evaluation shows Solution achieves metric1 (X% improvement) and metric2 (Y% overhead), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
```

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- **Too long**: Exceeding 250 words wastes reviewer time
- **Too vague**: "Significant security improvement" is meaningless without numbers
- **Missing results**: Readers need to know if your approach actually works
- **Repeating introduction**: Abstract should be self-contained, not a preview of the paper
- **Weak verbs**: Avoid "can be", "may", "might" — use "achieves", "demonstrates", "delivers"

## Tips for strong abstracts

1. Start with a compelling problem statement that hooks the reader
2. Make the gap between current defenses and your solution crystal clear
3. Use your most impressive quantitative results
4. Ensure each sentence adds value — no filler
5. Read it aloud to catch awkward phrasing
6. Have a colleague review it for clarity and completeness
