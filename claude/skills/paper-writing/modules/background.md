## What I do

I help you write background sections that provide non-expert readers with the technical foundation needed to understand your paper. Background should be objective, neutral, and focused — including only what's necessary for comprehension.

## When to use me

Use this skill when writing or revising your background section. I can help you:

- Organize technical concepts from simple to complex
- Decide what to include and what to exclude
- Use figures effectively to explain complex concepts
- Maintain neutral, objective tone without personal opinions
- Keep the section concise (1.5-2 pages maximum)

## How I work

I follow these core principles for background sections:

**Principle 1: Necessity Principle**
- Include only content essential for understanding your paper
- Exclude interesting but unnecessary details
- If you can understand your paper without it, it doesn't belong in background

**Principle 2: Layered Organization**
- Arrange concepts from simple to complex
- Introduce basic concepts before advanced ones
- Use clear subsection headings to separate topics
- Create a logical progression that builds understanding

**Principle 3: Figure-First Approach**
- Use high-quality figures to explain complex concepts
- Figures should be self-explanatory with clear captions
- One complex concept = one figure
- Use consistent symbols and colors throughout

**Principle 4: Fact-Based Writing**
- All technical facts should have sources
- Prefer original papers over secondary sources
- Avoid controversial statements
- Maintain objective, neutral tone

## Structure template

```
## 2. Background

### 2.1 [First Major Concept]
[Introductory paragraph explaining what this is and why it matters]

[Detailed explanation with figure if needed]

[Connection to your paper]

### 2.2 [Second Major Concept]
[Similar structure as above]

### 2.3 [Third Major Concept - if needed]
[Similar structure as above]
```

## Key distinctions

**Background vs. Related Work**
- Background: Foundational knowledge needed to understand this paper
- Related Work: Comparison of competing solutions and approaches
- Rule: Never evaluate or compare other systems in Background

**Background vs. Motivation**
- Background: "Here's how X works" (objective facts)
- Motivation: "Here's why X is insufficient" (problem analysis)
- Rule: Background should not argue that existing solutions are inadequate

## Content organization strategies

**Strategy 1: Concept-Based Organization**
Use when your paper builds on multiple independent concepts
- 2.1 Concept A
- 2.2 Concept B
- 2.3 Concept C

**Strategy 2: System-Based Organization**
Use when your paper extends or modifies an existing system
- 2.1 System Overview
- 2.2 Component A
- 2.3 Component B

**Strategy 3: Layered Organization**
Use when concepts build on each other
- 2.1 Basic Concept
- 2.2 Intermediate Concept
- 2.3 Advanced Concept

## Figure guidelines

**System Overview Figures**
- Show major components and their relationships
- Use clear, consistent symbols
- Label all important elements
- Include data flow and control flow indicators

**Technical Detail Figures**
- Illustrate specific mechanisms or algorithms
- Use tables or flowcharts as appropriate
- Label all parameters and constraints
- Make figures self-contained

**Comparison Figures**
- Show differences between related concepts
- Use consistent visual style
- Clearly label what's being compared
- Highlight key distinctions

## Common pitfalls to avoid

**Pitfall 1: Background Too Long**
- Problem: Reviewers lose patience with excessive background
- Solution: Strict 1.5-2 page limit; delete non-essential details
- Test: Can you understand your paper without this paragraph?

**Pitfall 2: Background vs. Related Work Confusion**
- Problem: Evaluating other systems or comparing approaches
- Solution: Background = facts, Related Work = comparison
- Test: Am I stating facts or making judgments?

**Pitfall 3: Assuming Inconsistent Knowledge Levels**
- Problem: Content is either too simple or too complex
- Solution: Target junior researchers in your field
- Test: Would someone new to this area understand this?

**Pitfall 4: Missing Figure Support**
- Problem: Complex concepts explained only in text
- Solution: One figure per complex concept
- Test: Could I understand this better with a figure?

**Pitfall 5: Insufficient Source Attribution**
- Problem: Technical facts without citations
- Solution: Cite original papers, not secondary sources
- Test: Could someone verify this claim?

## Writing techniques

1. **Use active voice**: "BPF programs execute in kernel space" not "kernel space is where BPF programs are executed"
2. **Define technical terms**: First mention should include definition or explanation
3. **Use consistent terminology**: Pick one term and stick with it
4. **Provide context**: "X is used for Y because Z" explains the "why"
5. **Avoid personal opinions**: Stick to objective facts

## Self-check questions

- [ ] Is every concept in this section essential for understanding my paper?
- [ ] Have I organized concepts from simple to complex?
- [ ] Do I have figures for all complex concepts?
- [ ] Is the tone neutral and objective?
- [ ] Have I cited sources for all technical facts?
- [ ] Is the section 1.5-2 pages long?
- [ ] Would someone unfamiliar with this area understand it?
- [ ] Have I avoided comparing or evaluating other systems?

## Revision checklist

1. Read each paragraph and ask: "Is this necessary?"
2. Check for any evaluative language (good, bad, better, worse)
3. Verify all technical facts have citations
4. Ensure figures are clear and well-labeled
5. Confirm consistent terminology throughout
6. Have a colleague review for clarity
7. Count pages and trim if necessary

## Tips for clarity

1. Start each subsection with a topic sentence
2. Use examples to illustrate abstract concepts
3. Provide concrete numbers or measurements
4. Explain the "why" not just the "what"
5. Use consistent notation and symbols
6. Define abbreviations on first use
