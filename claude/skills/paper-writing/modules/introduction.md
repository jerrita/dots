## What I do

I help you write introductions for security papers that accomplish three critical tasks: (1) capture reader attention, (2) establish the problem's importance, (3) provide a clear roadmap of your contributions. A strong introduction determines whether reviewers will engage deeply with your work.

## When to use me

Use this skill when writing or revising your paper's introduction. I can help you:

- Create a compelling opening hook with real-world impact
- Build a logical flow from background to problem to solution
- Present your contributions clearly using bullet points
- Set reader expectations for the paper structure

## How I work

I follow the proven five-paragraph structure for security paper introductions:

**Paragraph 1: Opening Hook (150-200 words)**
- Start with compelling real-world data or a concrete problem
- Describe the problem's scale and impact on real systems
- Establish why readers should care about this issue
- Use specific statistics, case studies, or concrete examples

**Paragraph 2: Background & Existing Solutions (200-250 words)**
- Introduce the current approach or defense mechanism
- Explain why this approach was adopted
- Cite key references that established this approach
- Prepare readers for the next section on limitations

**Paragraph 3: Problem Statement & Motivation (200-250 words)**
- Clearly articulate the specific gaps in existing solutions
- Use evidence (CVEs, research findings, statistics) to support your claims
- Explain why these gaps matter for security
- Build the case for why a new approach is needed

**Paragraph 4: Core Contributions (150-200 words)**
- Use 3-5 bullet points to list your main contributions
- Make each contribution clear, independent, and verifiable
- Order by importance
- Ensure each contribution has a corresponding section in your paper

**Paragraph 5: Paper Outline & Results Preview (100-150 words)**
- Briefly describe the paper's structure using section references (§)
- Preview key results without repeating the abstract
- Set expectations for what readers will learn

## Key principles

1. **Strong opening**: Use data, concrete examples, or compelling problems — not definitions
2. **Logical flow**: Each paragraph should lead naturally to the next
3. **Clear contributions**: Use bullet points; each should be one clear sentence
4. **Avoid excessive detail**: Introduction is not a preview of the design section
5. **Balance**: Don't spend too much space on background; focus on your contribution

## Example contribution structure

```
We make the following contributions:

• We present [System Name], the first work to [core innovation] using [key technique],
  effectively achieving [main goal].

• We design [specific technical approach] to address domain-specific challenges,
  including [challenge 1] and [challenge 2].

• We systematically evaluate [System Name] on [evaluation scope], demonstrating
  [key results] with [performance metrics].
```

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- **Weak hook**: Starting with definitions instead of compelling problems
- **Too much background**: Spending more than 250 words on existing solutions
- **Vague contributions**: "We improve security" is meaningless without specifics
- **Contribution-implementation confusion**: Contributions should be research contributions, not implementation details
- **Missing roadmap**: Readers should know what to expect in each section

## Writing techniques

1. **Use strong verbs**: "achieves", "demonstrates", "delivers", "enables" instead of "can be", "may"
2. **Quantify impact**: "affects 1 million systems" is better than "widely used"
3. **Create narrative flow**: Each paragraph should answer "why should I care about this?"
4. **Highlight novelty**: Make clear what's new compared to existing work
5. **Use parallel structure**: Contributions should follow similar grammatical patterns

## Self-check questions

- [ ] Is my opening hook compelling and specific?
- [ ] Do I clearly explain why existing solutions are insufficient?
- [ ] Are my contributions clear, independent, and verifiable?
- [ ] Does the paper outline prepare readers for what's coming?
- [ ] Would someone understand the paper's value from the introduction alone?
- [ ] Is the introduction approximately 1.5 pages?

## Revision tips

1. Read your introduction aloud to catch awkward phrasing
2. Ask: "Would I be excited to read this paper based on this introduction?"
3. Ensure each contribution is mentioned in the paper body
4. Check that the paper outline matches your actual sections
5. Have a colleague review for clarity and engagement
